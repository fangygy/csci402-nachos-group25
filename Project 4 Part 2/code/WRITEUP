I. Requirements:

	- Modify Nachos functionality to support server functionality (one server with passport office)
	- Implement distributed server functionality
	
II. Assumptions:
	
		With the design already laid out before us, provided in class, we had hoped that this project 
	would be fairly simple. Also, because of our disastrous Project 3, we decided to revert to
	Project 2 code, with increased NumPhysPages to 4096. Implementing the passport office across multiple clients linked to a single
	server should fairly smoothly done, although an overhaul on syscalls was necessary. Distributed servers
	seemed like it should be simple, but two days into the slipdate and we still cannot solve the problems
	that are occuring. Overall, the latter half of the project did not go as planned.

III. Design:

	- exception.cc
	- nettest.cc
	
	Part 1:
	We converted all of our Passport Office agents (customers, clerks, etc.) into user programs. All lock, condition variable, and monitor
	variable operations are handled with syscalls on the client-side and RPCs on the server-side.
	
	Part 2:
	We implemented the Total Ordering Algorithm to allow the Passport Office simulation to run with multiple servers. To handle message
	forwarding between servers, we made a TransServer thread that receives client requests. Clients attach a timestamp to their request
	message so that the servers know where to place the message in their Message Queues. The TransServer forwards the message to all
	servers, placing the message in their appropriate position in the Queue. Then each server sends Timestamp messages to all other servers;
	once the ehad of the Message Queue has a timestamp value that is less than or equal to the earliest timestamp message received by a server,
	the server will go ahead and process the message.
	
	Out Total Ordering Algorithm works most of the time for two servers, but the simulation breaks with any higher number of servers. With more
	than two servers, clients receive syscall error messages, as if they are performing illegal operations, i.e. acquiring a lock they haven't
	created. In these cases, the Passport Office simulation does not run to completion.
	

IV. Implementation:

	+ Files Modified
		+ exception.cc
		+ syscall.h
		+ system.h, system.cc
		+ Makefile (in test directory)
		+ machine.h
		+ nettest.cc
		+ list.h
		+ list.cc
	
	+ Files added
		+ Customer.c, AppClerk.c, PicClerk.c, PassClerk.c, CashClerk.c, Senator.c, Manager.c
		+ SimpleServerPassport.c, 10Customers.c, 5AppPicClerks.c, 5PassCashClerks.c, 1ManagerSenators.c
	
	+ Data Structures added
		-- in file nettest.cc
		struct Holder {			// Struct that holds a machineID and mailboxID
			int machineID;
			int mailboxID;
		};
		
		struct InnerLock {		// Lock struct that holds the info for acquisition and release
			bool exists;
			Holder holder;
			List *queue;
			List *machineIDQueue;
			List *mailboxIDQueue;
			Holder clientID[MAX_CLIENTS];
			int numClients;
		};

		struct ServerLock {		// Server lock that holds an array of InnerLocks, for locks with the same name
			char* name;
			bool exists;
			InnerLock lock[ARRAY_MAX];
		};

		struct InnerCV {		// CV struct that holds the info for condition usage
			bool exists;
			int waitingOuterLock;
			int waitingInnerLock;
			List* queue;
			List *machineIDQueue;
			List *mailboxIDQueue;
			Holder clientID[MAX_CLIENTS];
			int numClients;
		};

		struct ServerCV {		// Server CV that holds an array of InnerCVs, that share a name
			char* name;
			bool exists;
			InnerCV cv[ARRAY_MAX];
		};

		struct ServerMV {		// Server MV that holds an array of values, for MVs that share a name
			char* name;
			int value[ARRAY_MAX];
		};
		
		struct Message {		// Message struct for holding messages that have yet to be parsed
			int clientMachineID;
			int clientMailboxID;
			unsigned int timestamp;
			char* message;
			bool sender;
		};
		
		-- in list.h/.cc
		added int64_t key2 in ListElement to allow for two-parameter List insertion.
		added void List::SortedInsertTwo(void *item, int64_t sortKey, int64_t sortKey2) to perform two-parameter List insertion.
		This was necessary to add messages into a server's message queue in order, giving timestamp top priority and giving
		secondary priority to machine ID.
		
	+ Data Structures created
		-- In nettest.cc
			- TransServer thread, for the receiving server that will forward a client message 
				to all other servers
			- getTimestamp, which returns the current time for message sending
			- convertDecToBase, convertBaseToDec, used to convert to different bases and back to decimal,
				for shortening message length
V. Testing:

	+ How to test
		- Part 1
		Compile tests with gmake in the test directory
		If you haven't done so beforehand, gmake in network directory
		To run tests, call them in network directory
		
		*NOTE* Make sure that NUM_SERVERS in system.cc is set equal to 1
		*NOTE* Make sure to run "nachos -m 0" to set up the Server before running other clients
		
		To run a simple passport office (2 Customers, 1 of everything else)
		nachos -x ../test/SimpleServerPassport -m 1
		
		To run a full passport office: (In this order on different machines)
		(30 Customers, 5 of each Clerk, 5 of each Senator, 1 Manager)
		nachos -x ../test/10Customers.c -m 1
		nachos -x ../test/10Customers.c -m 2
		nachos -x ../test/10Customers.c -m 3
		nachos -x ../test/5AppPicClerks.c -m 4
		nachos -x ../test/5PassCashClerks.c -m 5
		nachos -x ../test/1ManagerSenators.c -m 6
		
		- Part 2
		Compile tests with gmake in the test directory
		If you haven't done so beforehand, gmake in network directory
		To run tests, call them in network directory
		
		*NOTE* Make sure that "NUM_SERVERS" in system.cc is set equal to 1-5
		*NOTE* Make sure to run "nachos -m X" (X being 0 - 4 depending on servers) to set up the Server before running other clients
		

	+ Test Output
		All our tests output expected results. 

		- SimpleServerPassport execs 2 Customers, 1 of each Clerk, 1 Senator, and 1 Manager. 
			- Runs to completion with 1 Server.
			- Sometimes runs to completion with 2 Servers.
			- Does not run to completion with more than 2.
		- Full Passport Office is run across multiple Nachos machines
			- 10Customers execs 10 Customers
			- 5AppPicClerks execs 5 Application Clerks and 5 Picture Clerks
			- 5PassCashClerks execs 5 Passport Clerks and 5 Cashiers
			- 1ManagerSenators execs 5 Senators and 1 Manager
			
			- Runs to completion with 1 Server.
			- Runs to completion most of the time with 2 Servers.
			- Does not run to completion with more than two.
			
VI. Discussion:

		Mostly for part 1, we had to overhaul our syscalls and server functions to allow for arrays of locks, conditions, and
	monitor variables that share a name, such as appLock[NUM_CLERKS] and picState[NUM_CLERKS] (from previous passport offices).
	Overall, this went as planned, and only required adding an additional struct within the previously created ServerLocks,
	ServerCVs, and ServerMVs. This went as expected.
	
	
		
VII. Miscellaneous:
