I. Requirements:

	- Describe what's your understanding of the requirements from the assignment statement. 
	  With the requirement analysis, you would be clear about what you are supposed to do.
	- Build a synchronized, multi-threaded system utilizing shared data and a monitor
	- Use this system to simulate a passport office, with customer prioritizarion and clerks
	
II. Assumptions:

	- Reasonable assumptions you take for your scheme.

III. Design:

	- This section is to cover your logic and ideas as to how 
	you are going to solve the problem presented. 
	This should include a description of classes, algorithms, etc.
	
	- Customer
		- Local variables include a unique identifier (SSN), cash on hand (randomly chosen increments of
			$100, $600, $1100, $1600), and four boolean flags
			- Each flag keeps track of which clerk the customer has visited: ApplicationClerk, PictureClerk,
				PassportClerk, and Cashier
			- WHILE any flag is false, stay inside this loop
		- There is a random chance to go to passport line before the application and picture clerks
			- This only happens once
			- Customer will be punished upon being rejected, waiting a certain number of 
				currentThread->Yield calls
		- Visits clerks in order of ApplicationClerk == PictureClerk > PassportClerk > Cashier
			- If customer has enough money, will always enter the privileged line UNLESS
				both regular and privileged lines are empty. Gotta save money, right?
			- When choosing between ApplicationClerk and PictureClerk, chooses whichever has the
				shortest line, taking into account privileged and empty lines. If both lines are tied
				or empty, then go to ApplicationClerk.
		- Checks for Senators in three different situations:
			- Before entering the office, if senators are present, go directly into the
				Waiting Room.
			- Between entering lines for different clerks, if senators are present, go 
				directly to the Waiting Room.
			- While in line, if senators are present, go directly to the Waiting Room, but remember
				that customer was in which line.
	- Senator
		- Senators do not actively start lining up until the Passport Office is cleared of
			all regular customers (can't be in the same room as riff-raffs, eh)
			- Waits for the Manager to alert them that all customers have gone into the 
				Waiting Room
		- Otherwise, behaves exactly the same as customers when dealing with each different type
			of clerk
		- After all senators are finished, the Manager alerts all Customers to continue doing
			whatever they were already doing
	
	- AppClerk
		- Keeps track of the customer's SSN (also the index) and type (customer or senator)
		- While this thread is running
			- check to see if the privileged line has customers first, then check the regular line
			- when checking each line:
				- decrease the line length
				- set itself to available
				- Signal the customer to let it know the clerk is ready
				- then wait for the customer's response
				- Once the customer responds, read the SSN from the data array
				- check the customer type
				- Set the customer's state to reflect the Application phase DONE
				- Process the application, then signal the customer and release it
			- If no customers in either line, go on break
				- Wake up when Manager sees that there are customers in line
	
	- PicClerk
		- Keeps track of the customer's SSN (also the index) and type (customer or senator)
		- While this thread is running
			- check to see if the privileged line has customers first, then check the regular line
			- when checking each line:
				- decrease the line length
				- set itself to available
				- Signal the customer to let it know the clerk is ready
				- then wait for the customer's response
				- Once the customer responds, read the SSN from the data array
				- check the customer type
				- Then proceed to take the customer's picture
					- will loop as long as the picture is disliked by the customer
					- There is a bool in the picture clerk data array for the customer to let
					- him know if the picture is liked or not
					- Will loop out once the picture is liked, and the pic clerk will continue to process
				- Set the customer's state to reflect the Picture phase DONE
				- Process the picture then signal the customer and release it
			- If no customers in either line, go on break
				- Wake up when Manager sees that there are customers in line
	
	- PassClerk
		- Keep track of the SSN (also the index) and type of the current customer
		- While this thread is running
			- check to see if the privileged line has customers first, then check the regular line
			- when checking each line:
				- decrease the line length
				- set self to available
				- Signal the customer to let it know the clerk is ready
				- Wait for the customer's response
				- set state to BUSY
				- Signal the first customer and wait for them
				- record their SSN and type
				- if customer has filed their application and taken their picture
					- make a note to do their passport
					- Signal the customer
				- else
					- punish and signal the customer
				- If customer was in privileged line, accept their payment
				- If I'm supposed to file the passport
					- Yield (to simulate doing work)
					- file the passport
			- If no customers in either line, go on break
				- Wake up when Manager sees that there are customers in line
	
	- Cashier
		- Keep track of the SSN (also the index) and type of the current customer
		- While this thread is running
			- When checking the line:
				- decrease the line length
				- set self to available
				- Signal the customer to let it know the cashier is ready
				- Wait for the customer's response
				- set state to BUSY
				- Signal the first customer and wait for them
				- record their SSN and type
				- if customer's passport has been filed
					- accept the customer's passport fee
					- Signal the customer
				- else
					- punish and signal the customer
			- If no customers in either line, go on break
				- Wake up when Manager sees that there are customers in line
	
	- Manager
		- keeps track of the total money made by the office
		- while this thread is running
			- constantly check all clerk lines for customers
			- if customers exist, depending on the number, wake up either
			- one clerk or all clerks for that line
			- also checks for senators and broadcasts to everyone 
			- if a senator is there
			- will also print out a money report that includes
			- the office's total money as well as each clerk's money

            + Functions modified and in which file.

V. Testing:  (For each test case, you must show)
	+ How to test
		Compile with gmake in the threads directory.
		To test part 1 of assignment, run 'nachos -T'
		To test part 2 of assignment, we have 4 different test cases:
			Run office with 20 customers.
			Run office with 30 customers.
			Run office with 50 customers.
			Run office with 1 customer.

			To run each, type either 'nachos -P2,' 'nachos P3',' nachos P4', 
			or 'nachos P5' respectively

	+ Test Output
		Our part 1 of the assignment runs through all test cases and outputs the proper results as
		described in test_code.cc.
		As for part 2, our code compiles, and customers are able to run through Application Clerks without problems
		but depending on the number of customers, the program will stop running
		or infinitely stall at certain points that involve signal/wait issues.

VI. Discussion:
	+ Experiment expectation.  (What you hope will happen.)
	+ Experiment result.  (What actually happens.)
	+ Explanation
		In this assignment, we learned how threads work in operating systems and computer code.
		We experimented on how threads can interact with each other
		and perform multiple functions simulteaously.

		Our expectation from our design was that everything would go smoothly (aside from some
		compilation debugging with syntax and such). We meticulously discussed and went through
		the processes and interactions between the way threads will communicate with each other,
		tracing between locks and condition variables to make sure race conditions and 
		context switches don't happen. We were confident things would run smoothly overall.

		Our result was not what we expected. While we did get delayed from solving certain syntactical 
		errors that we were unsure of how to solve, our final dilemma came down to
		our program running through certain threads smoothly, but then stopping at other threads.
		This was particular for signal/wait situations, where one thread would signal another thread,
		only to find the latter never waking up despite us using the correct locks and CVs.
		We believed the code would run smoothly otherwise, as our code compiles easily now.
		However, when run, our program does not manage to allow a customer to finish through
		the passport office. It will usually run through the Application Clerk successfully, and then
		get stuck either in the PictureClerk, PassportClerk, Cashier, or when a Manager attemps to
		wake a Clerk from break.
