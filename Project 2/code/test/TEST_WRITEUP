Test files:
	forkTest
	execTest
	lockTest
	CVTest
	execCVTest

Test Functionalities:
	forkTest:
		Tests the fork syscall. Contains a test function called testFunc 
		that simply writes out a string output when called. The main function
		forks testFunc twice, thus testing the functionality of the Fork
		syscall by seeing if output gets printed out twice.
		Afterwards, forktest calls several "bad" Fork syscalls by using
		improper parameters such as out of bound index, wrong types, and 
		nonexistant functions.
		Output consists of print statements in the test file that describes its current
		actions (testing fork or testing bad forks), as well as the error
		statements printed out from the exception handler whenever bad calls
		are done. These won't crash Nachos.

	execTest:
		Tests both the functionality of the Exec syscall as well as properly
		runs the forkTest. 
		First attempts to execute a bad file.
		Afterwards, Exec is called to run forkTest.

	lockTest:
		Comprehensive test file that tests Lock functionality. Includes testing
		for CreateLock, Acquire, Release, and DestroyLock. 
		First attempts to destroy nonexistant locks.
		Then it creates a proper lock.
		Then tries to release nonexistant or bad locks.
		Then releases the proper lock.
		Then tries to acquire nonexistant or bad locks.
		Then acquires the proper lock twice, which shouldn't change the fact
		it has acquired it, and should not crash Nachos.
		After acquiring the lock, then it releases it again.
		Finally, it destroys the proper lock.
		This test tests for both the good and the bad calls for all the basic
		lock-related functions. Output consists of clear print statements
		written to the Console whenever it attempts to create, acquire, release,
		or destroy a lock. When bad syscalls are called, the print statements
		in the ExceptionHandler should output error messages. Nachos will not crash
		when errors happen, but should continue onto the next call.

	CVTest:
		Comprehensive test program to test Condition Variable functionality.
		Includes testing for CreateCondition, Wait, Signal, and DestroyCondition.
		Also contains a testFunc function to properly test Wait and Signal
		functionality across multiple threads.
		First it attempts to destroy nonexistant or bad conditions.
		Then it will create proper locks and CVs.
		Afterward, it will fork to the testFunc function, and then immediately start
		yielding to ensure the testFunc runs its code first.
		The testFunc will start by acquiring the created lock. Afterwards it will
		wait on the CV with the lock.
		Once the main thread is done yielding, it will attempt to signal various bad combinations
		of Signal calls, after which it will properly signal the CV on the lock,
		which will wake up the testFunc thread and it will release its lock.
		Afterwards, testFunc will attempt to wait on bad calls (nonexistant bad locks
		and CVS), while the main thread acquires the lock and then destroys the condition.


	execCVTest:
		This test's sole purpose is to properly run the CVTest. On the side, it acts
		as an alternate test of Exec. It will output that it runs, afterwhich it should
		just run CVTest.
