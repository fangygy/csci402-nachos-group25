I. Requirements:

	- Modify the Nachos code to support multiprogramming.
	- Implement system calls and exception handling.
	- Use this new system to simulate the passport office done in Project 1
	
II. Assumptions:

	- We assumed... //guys? any ideas? I'll leave this part for further discussion

III. Design:
	- // List out the new classes we made along with the ones we modified. Off the top of my head 
	  // I can think of:

	- exception.cc
	- process.cc/h
	- syscall.h
	- addrspace.cc/h

IV. Implementation:

	+ Files Modified
		+ addrspace.h, addrspace.cc
		+ exception.cc
		+ syscall.h
		+ Makefile.common
		+ Makefile (in test directory)
	
	+ Files added
		+ process.h, process.cc
	
	+ Data Structures added
		-- in blah class.cc
		
	+ Data Structures created
		-- in blah blah .cc

V. Testing:

	+ How to test
		Compile tests with gmake in the test directory.
		If haven't done so beforehand, gmake programs in userprog directory.
		To run tests, you must call them in the userprog directory.

		To run lockTest, type:
		nachos -x ../test/lockTest

		To run execTest or forkTest, type:
		nachos -x ../test/execTest

		To run execCVTest or CVTest, type:
		nachos -x ../test/execCVTest

	+ Test Output
		All our tests output expected results. For more a more in-depth discussion
		of our test cases, you can reference the TEST_WRITEUP in the test directory.

		- Our most basic test, execTest, tests both good and bad usage of the Exec syscall. 
		Calling a bad file name or anything other than a proper program will output an 
		error message but will not crash Nachos. It will then continue on to call Exec on 
		the second test, forkTest, which tests our Fork syscall. execTest properly executes 
		forkTest, thus we know Exec works. 
		- forkTest tests our Fork functionality by calling Fork on a test function that simply
		prints out a statement to show it works. forkTest calls Fork twice, so we expected 
		two output statements from the function, which it did. Afterwards, it would call
		Fork using bad inputs, which printed out the errors that we expected while not crashing the system.
		- lockTest and CVTest (the latter of which executes with execCVTest) both test the
		functionality of all our Lock and Condition Variable related syscalls, including Acquire,
		Release, Wait, Signal, and Broadcast, along with thier respective Create and Destroy syscalls.
		The test cases utilize simple functions to test the order of execution using
		the functions Wait, Signal, and Broadcast along with the usage of Acquire and Release. 
		All tests output expected results without crashing Nachos unexpectedly.
