I. Requirements:

	- Modify the Nachos code to support multiprogramming.
	- Implement system calls and exception handling.
	- Use this new system to simulate the passport office done in Project 1
	
II. Assumptions:

	- We assumed... //guys? any ideas? I'll leave this part for durther discussion

III. Design:
	- // List out the new classes we made along with the ones we modified. Off the top of my head 
	  // I can think of:

	- exception.cc
	- process.cc/h
	- syscall.h
	- addrspace.cc/h

IV. Implementation:

	+ Files Modified
		+ addrspace.h, addrspace.cc
		+ exception.cc
		+ syscall.h
		+ Makefile.common
		+ Makefile (in test directory)
	
	+ Files added
		+ process.h, process.cc
	
	+ Data Structures added
		-- in blah class.cc
		
	+ Data Structures created
		-- in blah blah .cc

V. Testing:

	+ How to test
		Compile tests with gmake in the test directory.
		If haven't done so beforehand, gmake programs in userprog directory.
		To run tests, you must call them in the userprog directory.

		To run lockTest, type:
		nachos -x ../test/lockTest

		To run execTest/forkTest, type:
		nachos -x ../test/execTest

		To run execCVTest/CVTest, type:
		nachos -x ../test/execCVTest

	+ Test Output


VI. Discussion:



VII. Miscellaneous:
